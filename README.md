# knative/networking

This repository contains the Knative Ingress and Certificate CRDs, as well as
their conformance tests. These are our extension points to plugin different
Ingress plugins (Ambassador, Contour, Gloo, Istio, Kong and Kourier), as well as
different AutoTLS plugins (CertManager and Knative's own HTTP01 challenge
solver).

# Knative Ingress aka KIngress

The Knative Ingress CRD is based on the Kubernetes Ingress CRD, with the
following additions:

1. Traffic splitting
2. Header modification applied to requests based on the traffic split they are
   assigned to.
3. Host header rewrite
4. Traffic redirection predicates based on a regexp based condition on headers.

In addition to these, we previously added Timeout and Retry settings but no
longer used them and may deprecate these parts in future versions.

See
https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#install-a-networking-layer
for a list of the current supported KIngress implementations.

# Knative Certificate aka KCert

Knative Certificate CRD is a Knative abstraction for various SSL certificate
provisioning solutions (such as cert-manager or self-signed SSL certificate).
